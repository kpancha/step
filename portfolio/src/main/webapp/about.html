        Welcome! I'm Kira and here's a glimpse into my life and work. 
        I am a Computer Science major at Georgia Tech with over two years of experience in the field.
        My major-specific concentrations are Artificial Intelligence and Theory, and I am specifically interested in machine learning and algorithm design.

        I grew up in central New Jersey with my parents, brother, and labradoodle. 
        In high school, I was involved in varsity and club soccer, Girl Scouts, Bharatanatyam (classical Indian dance), Science Olympiad, and singing.
        Now, whenver I'm not behind my laptop you can find me dancing with my Bollywood-fusion dance team, ATL Satrangi, exploring a new community on an Alternative Service Break trip, or going on an adventure with my sisters in Alpha Chi Omega.
        I have also been a TA for Intro Physics I and am currently working on a CS research team in the <a href="https://www.coskunlab.org/">Coskun Lab</a> at Georgia Tech.
